# complex-word-tagging
This project uses machine learning to detect complex words and give hyperlinks to their meanings in a docx file, from a given ".txt" file. This is a fork from a private ongoing project of ours. Currently this project is (kind of) usable by the general public (read: people who know how to run python scripts).
